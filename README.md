## A new toki pona font

I borrowed the magnificient sitelen sitelenâ€™s vectorisation made by **jan Same** to build a simple font. I added the latin transcription under the ideogram to make it easier to understand and help learning it.

To use it phonetically (nimisin), you just have to type in **capital letters**.

## Containers

There are a number of **containers** you can use. They make reading easier because they segment the sentence into units. If you need a 'space' inside a container, use "_" instead.

## last update 1.3.6
*Thanks to the help of jan Maje*
1. _lon is corrected
2. small spaces between words inside a container are corrected
3. to add a space inside a container, use _ (underscore)
4. recenter quite a few latin chars
5. _poka is fixed
6. _tawa is fixed
7. capital letters in containers are fixed
8. left bracket followed by underscore is fixed
